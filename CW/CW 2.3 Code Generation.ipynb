    "## The Target Language \n",
    "\n",
    "We will again use the ``FUNC`` language from CW 2.1 and CW 2.2, see there for a description. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, you will extend the basic solution with function calls.\n",
    "You will want to copy over your solution from CW 2.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is additional information on the requirements for function calls:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can use ``$t8`` and ``$t9`` for intermediate computations as we have done for SIMP.\n",
    "- The code in the ``main()`` function should be executed (using the ``start_:`` label in MIPS). You have to put ``.global _start`` at the beginning of the assembly code to ensure that the assembler finds this label.\n",
    "    - All other functions can only be reached by calling them from ``main`` (possibly indirectly via other functions).\n",
    "    - ``main`` cannot be called by any functions (including ``main``).\n",
    "- You can assume that there are sufficient registers to hold all variables in a function.\n",
    "    - Registers should be allocated in the order variables are introduced, starting with ``$s0/$t0``\n",
    "    - Use the ``$s0-$s7`` registers to store variables of the ``main()`` function. \n",
    "    - Use the ``$t0-$t7`` registers for the variables of other functions.\n",
    "    - There are no global variables.\n",
    "- Use ``$a0-$a3`` to store function arguments. You may assume that there are not more than 4 arguments.\n",
    "- Use ``$v0`` to store the return value. The variable declared in the optional return statement at the end of each method should be returned in ``$v0``.\n",
    "- You are allowed to define an arbitrary number of additional functions - but please use the high-level functions for compilation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The appendix (bottom of this document) contains an example of generated code which you will want to ensure that you understand before you start coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Marking Scheme**. \n",
    "You will get 6/10 points for developing a solution which supports basic function calls (but no nested/recursive calls). \n",
    "This means you need to implement a suitable register-based protocol where ``$a0-$a3`` is used for arguments, and ``$v0`` for the result. You can assume a maximum of 4 arguments. Remember, you should use the ``$t0-$t7`` registers for local variables (except for main() where ``$s0-$s7`` are used).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will get the remaining 4/10 points if your solution also supports recursive and nested calls. To achieve this, you need to develop a stack frame. As all variables are in registers, (when required) you will need to push a stack frame with all caller-save registers before the call is made and pop them back to the correct registers when control is returned to the caller\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Hints \n",
    "\n",
    "*The assignment is doable without the following hints; but if you need an additional starting point, the following contains a more detailed description on what to do.*\n",
    "\n",
    "You will want to start to ensure that you \n",
    "- understand the details on the slides about function calls. \n",
    "- understand the example generated code in the appendix with annotations and understand each of the instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to the basic solution, you will have then to implement the following features: \n",
    "- When compiling expressions, you have to add the general case of ``App (s, es)``. In this case, you have to: \n",
    "    - Push the stack frame with all caller-save registers. You might want to use the function ``all_registers :: int Env.t -> register list`` which returns all registers currently registered in the environment.\n",
    "    - Ensure that the expressions ``es`` are compiled into the argument registers ``$a0-$a3``. (Recall that you can assume that there are never more than 4 arguments.) \n",
    "        - Hint: You might want to use an additional function ``compile_exps env (rs : register list) (es : exp list) : code`` for doing so, mutually recursive with ``compile_exp`` (``and compile_exps env (rs : register list) (es : exp list) : code = match rs, es with ... ``).\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - Register the return address and jump to the label of the subroutine (which is responsible to bring you back to the next instruction).\n",
    "    - Pop the stack frame.\n",
    "    - Move the value at ``$v0`` into the goal register.\n",
    "- When using the argument registers for ``syscall``, you have to push/pop ``$a0`` to ensure you are not overwriting the arguments.\n",
    "- ``compile_method`` has now also to support arbitrary methods. In particular, this means that \n",
    "    - You have to add a label for the subroutine at the beginning of the code of your method.\n",
    "    - ``compile_dcls`` has to distinguish whether variables are declared in the ``main()`` function or from another function. The pre-defined function ``declare_local_var: int Env.t -> string -> int Env.t`` behaves similar to ``declare_var`` but adds a variable to ``$t0-$t7`` instead of ``$s0-$s7``.\n",
    "    - You require to declare the argument registers at the beginning of a method; you might want to write a new function for this.\n",
    "    - You need to jump back to the return address ``$ra`` at the end of a not-main method. "
